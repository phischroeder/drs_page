The Departmental Research Seminar is designed to provide academic staff and PhD students with an opportunity to workshop current research with the rest of the department. Seminars will take place throughout the term and attendance is open to all who are interested. The sessions are not limited to specific subfields and participation by all staff and PhD students is welcome. The idea is to create a forum that brings together individuals with diverse interests. 
<br />
Presentations are not expected. Discussions will take the form of an informal Q&A session. Papers are distributed at least one week prior to each session. Participants are expected to read the manuscript ahead of time and to come prepared with comments or questions. Please email alexandra.hartman@ucl.ac.uk to be added to the mailing list, through which the papers are distributed.
