The Departmental Research Seminar at UCL's Department of Political Science is designed to provide academic staff and PhD students with an opportunity to workshop current research with the rest of the department. Seminars will take place throughout the term and attendance is open to all who are interested. The sessions are not limited to specific subfields and participation by all staff and PhD students is welcome. The idea is to create a forum that brings together individuals with diverse interests.

    <a href = "https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=3156133" target="_blank" >Title: From Claims to Violence: Signaling, Outbidding, and Escalation in Ethnic Conflict</a>
    Do strategic divisions within ethnic movements affect conflict dynamics and the escalation to violence?
We contend that organizations use claims strategically as signaling devices not only to
communicate demands and resolve to the state, in order to position themselves within the broader
ethnic movement in ways that affect relations with the state. As organizations advance demands
to distinguish themselves from others, movements become more fragmented, and more diverse
should increase the likelihood of bargaining failure. Whereas previous studies of ethnic civil conflict
have treated ethnic movements as unitary or have analyzed the number of organizations as a
proxy for fragmentation, we use a new dataset on organizations representing ethnic groups detailing
their specific claims. Our empirical analysis shows that the risk of ethnic conflict increases
with the number of factions with different claims within an ethnic movement; outbidding among
organizations within an ethnic movement significantly increases the risk of ethnic civil conflict;
and territorial claims are particularly likely to spur conflict escalation.
